    "# Mathematical Model Order Reduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows how to create a reduced model using mathematical model order reduction (MOR). We will reduce a computationally demanding Fokker-Planck-Mckean-Vlasov type meanfield model of FitzHugh-Nagumo neurons. The model is a nonlinear partial differential equation, therefore it must be studied numerically.\n",
    "\n",
    "With mathematical MOR, we can create a reduced model that _approximates_ the original, computationally demanding model so that _no assumptions_ or _simplifications_ are done. In other words, the reduced model is able to model _every_ variable of the original system. This is in contrast to using simplified models such as the integrate and fire model, to approximate a complex system like the Hodgkin-Huxley model.\n",
